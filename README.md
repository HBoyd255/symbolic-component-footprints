# Symbolic Component Footprints

Harry Boyd - hboyd255@gmaIl.com - 22/05/2024

This is a KiCad library of footprints for a few generic components, where the
footprints resemble the symbol of the component. This is useful for creating 
PCBs for educational purposes.

In these footprints, the lines that represent connections are 0.3mm wide.

## Symbolic 2k Resistor

This is a footprint for a 0.25W 5-band 2k resistor. The footprint is a rectangle
and the 3D model has the correct coloured bands.
