# Symbolic Component Footprints

Harry Boyd - hboyd255@gmaIl.com - 22/05/2024

This is a KiCad library of footprints for a few generic components, where the
footprints resemble the symbol of the component. This is useful for creating
PCBs for educational purposes.

In these footprints, the lines that represent connections are 0.4mm wide.

## Symbolic Resistor

This is a footprint for a generic through hole resistor. The leg holes are
10.16mm apart, equivalent to 4 breadboard holes.

This library has no default 3D model. 3D models should be chosen based on the
value of the resistor. Step files for every 5 Band e24 resistor can be found at

Here is an example of a 2k resistor from the
[e24 collection.](https://github.com/HBoyd255/every-e24-resistor)

# Symbolic Button

This is a footprint for a generic through 2 pin tactile button. The leg holes
are 5.6mm apart, equivalent to 2 breadboard holes.

# Symbolic NPN EBC Transistor

This is a footprint for a generic through hole NPN transistor, such as the
2N3904. The leg holes are 2.54mm apart, equivalent to 1 breadboard hole.
